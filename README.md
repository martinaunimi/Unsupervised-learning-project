## Unsupervised project
In recent years, there has been much discussion about the possibility
of a multi-speed Europe, namely the idea of a differentiated integration that could
take into account the diversity that European countries show. Therefore, it is crucial
to understand how we can group the European countries according to some variables,
which are not related to the geographic location, but to their socio-demographic and
economic situation. In order to perform this task, the research exploits two different
unsupervised algorithms, the hierarchical clustering and the k-means clustering. Finally, the PCA method is used in order to understand how the variables relate to each
other and to have in conclusion a visual representation of the data in a two dimensional
space, onto which most of the variance is captured.
